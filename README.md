================

Druude provides a scaffolding framework for applications. Modeled (somewhat) after rails & play framework, it intends to enable you to build out apps quickly and without much fuss.  It's going to start with building Android applications since that's what I'm expert at right now, but it's scope will increase to iOS, Unity3d, node and beyond over time.

Druude's design allows for new subprojects using git submodules.
